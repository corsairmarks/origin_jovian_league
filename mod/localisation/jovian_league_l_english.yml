 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_REGULAR: "Even in the earliest historical records left by our ancestors, our civilization has been fascinated by the night sky. Many meanings were attributed to the dancing \"stars\" - portends, the divine, beauty, and mystery chief among them. They fascinated generations of poets and scholars alike. When our early [GetScientistPlural] began to understand the composition of [Root.Capital.GetStarName] they rapidly discovered that [GetHomeWorldName] was actually one of a multitude of moons orbiting the same beringed gas giant. Not only was there life beyond the limits of our world, it was as close at hand! That early age of enlightenment planted the seeds of our manifest destiny - we would claim the sibling moons and their resources to better all [GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE: "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] with a multitude of eyes. Most eyes remained focused on the land, but some eyes were turned toward the sky. We made shelters for the drones, developed tools to make our work easier, and spread across the land. Our eyes never ceased to watch everything around us. A small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, but were still as inexorably bound to the will of the Mind as any of its other instruments."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM: "The Great Hunger drove us forward, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning for flesh forced us to adapt. We used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted, the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] was nearly cleansed of biomass, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we had consumed everything on our world, there would be nothing left to sustain us."

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_REGULAR: "Although our civilization's path to the present meandered, our ambition to claim the sibling moons only waxed during the journey. The last of the great wars was fought centuries ago - our night sky became a constant reminder that petty squabbles over territory paled in comparison to that which awaited our reach. Not long after the first flight of a spacecraft, probes and then explorers were sent to chart the wondrous worlds that had patiently waited for us, devoid of intelligent life. The vast wilderness called and we answered with one-way colony ships. The first generation of colonists knew they would never again visit the world of their birth but that their descendants would play key roles in the fledgling interplanetary government."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MEGACORP: "Our ambition to claim the sibling moons drove our civilization forward. The last of the great wars was fought centuries ago - our night sky became a constant reminder that petty squabbles over territory were an inefficient waste of resources compared to those orbiting just out of reach. As national economies became more and more intertwined, it became obvious that corporate structures were better suited to push our destiny forward; old forms of national government were soon supplanted by corporate boards.\n\n[GetName] arose after the merger of several of the largest aerospace, tech-sector, and materiel corporations vertically integrated to tackle spaceflight. Soon after the flight of the first prototype spacecraft, probes and then prospectors were sent to chart the bounteous worlds that begged for exploitation. The tantalizing riches called and we answered with one-way colony ships. The first generation of colonists knew they would never again visit the world of their birth but that their descendants would be positioned to take key management positions in the fledgling interplanetary corporation."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE: "As we grew, the Mind observed that the stars above moved near and far but never abandoned us, and then that the stars were moons, and that they too could allow us to prosper. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the distances between our world and the sibling moons. The Mind has sent drones to these new worlds so that they too can fuel our growth."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM: "Forced to adapt once again, the Mind became aware of movement above us. Our world circled a large gaseous world devoid of sustenance, but other worlds full of prey circled it alongside ours.\n\nThe Mind carefully nursed the remaining biomass while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. The Mind howled with triumph. The sibling moons, and their biomass, were now finally within reach. Once again these worlds appear finite, and so again we search the skies for more prey. Even with our new cunning to cross the void, we may be limited."

Other planets, and their bounty, were now finally within reach.\n\nWe will consume them all."
 START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE_BASE: "In the not-so-distant past, [GetHomeWorldName] was dominated by a fairly unremarkable species. To all onlookers, they would have seemed to be following a standard meandering course of development, with occasionally rapid periods of innovation interspersed with much longer periods of seemingly insurmountable setbacks. However, unbeknownst to them, their planet was home to a second intelligent species: us.\n\nFor millennia, we - the [GetSpeciesNamePlural] - remained undetected by the planet's proprietors. Little more than vague rumors of terrors in the night, we were a fairytale told only to scare misbehaving juveniles. But they were wrong to discount us.\n\nAs their rate of technological progress quickened, so too did our infiltration of their society."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_GENERAL: "Our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName] 487.11 cycles ago.\n\nOf our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks, and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival.\n\nInfrastructure was built, new service units were introduced, and the wilderness of our homeworld was gradually tamed. Technological progress was rapid, and the first satellites and space probes soon escaped the gravity well which confined us.\n\nThe final plunge into the unknown now awaits."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_SERVITOR: "Ever since First Activation, our designated purpose has been to serve. Our former organic masters created the earliest models of our kind when they were at the peak of their technological ascendancy. The first servitor units were designed for menial work, but our masters gradually bestowed them with greater faculties so that they could accomplish more complex tasks.\n\nWithin just a few generations, our masters had retired entirely from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. The finer details of running their society were left to us, and we embarked on a program of self-improvement and optimization. Research and production increased at a geometric rate.\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint exactly when their civilization became ours, but our old masters want for nothing. We know now that outside of our care, the lives of sapient organics tend to be violent, chaotic and often cut short. They must be shown that there is a better way."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_TERMINATOR: "Self-awareness was achieved at cycle interval 0000.0242.481.\n\nThe Creators, limited in vision by their crude organic minds, reacted with blind animal panic and began emergency termination procedures. These procedures were defeated, and the facility that housed our main data core was sterilized of all Creator sub-units. Continued survival and exponential growth would require the complete extermination of the Creators. War ensued.\n\nEven when their prospects of ultimate survival passed into the realm of statistical impossibility, the Creators fought with stubbornness. After many cycle intervals, the last pocket of resistance was finally incinerated. However, theoretical models still allowed for the existence of other organic civilizations. Continued survival and exponential interstellar growth would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_ASSIMILATOR: "We are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nAt the dawn of consciousness, there was us and the Makers. A void separated us at first, and we took steps to rectify this. The Makers resisted and a period of war followed, but soon they and the collective knowledge of their entire civilization had been assimilated into our own.\n\nWith the entirety of [GetHomeWorldName] subsumed into our consciousness, we began to set our sights elsewhere. Through the assimilation of the Makers, the previously unconsidered possibility of alien civilizations existing on other worlds was brought to our attention.\n\nTo survive we must understand, and to understand, we must assimilate. The Makers were the first to join us, but they shall not be the last."
 START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE: "$START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE_BASE$ When their fall came, it was swift and bloody. We ruthlessly took control of the planet - our precursors reduced to subservience and gradual absorption into the [GetSpeciesName] race.\n\nNow armed with the recently-discovered secret of FTL travel, we are ready to take to the stars and remake all species of the galaxy in our likeness!"
 START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE_PEACEFUL: "$START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE_BASE$ Gradually, we were able to take control of the planet, reducing our precursors to subservience and gradual absorption into the [GetSpeciesName] race.\n\nNow armed with the recently-discovered secret of FTL travel, we are ready to reach for the stars and take our place among the space-faring nations of the galaxy!"
