 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_REGULAR: "Even in the earliest historical records left by our ancestors, our civilization has been fascinated by the night sky. Many meanings were attributed to the dancing \"stars\" - portends, the divine, beauty, and mystery chief among them. They fascinated generations of poets and scholars alike. When our early [GetScientistPlural] began to understand the composition of [Root.Capital.GetStarName] they rapidly discovered that [GetHomeWorldName] was actually one of a multitude of moons orbiting the same beringed gas giant. Not only was there life beyond the limits of our world, it was as close at hand! That early age of enlightenment planted the seeds of our manifest destiny - we would claim the sibling moons and their resources to better all [GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE: "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] with a multitude of eyes. Most eyes remained focused on the land, but some eyes were turned toward the sky. We made shelters for the drones, developed tools to make our work easier, and spread across the land. Our eyes never ceased to watch everything around us. A small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, but were still as inexorably bound to the will of the Mind as any of its other instruments."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM: "The Great Hunger drove us forward, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning for flesh forced us to adapt. We used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted, the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] was nearly cleansed of biomass, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we had consumed everything on our world, there would be nothing left to sustain us."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM_LITHOID: "The Great Hunger drove us forward, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning to grow forced us to adapt. We used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted upon the surface of [GetHomeWorldName], we nearly caused our own destruction, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we had consumed our world, there would be nothing left to sustain us."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE: "Many cycles ago, our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName]. Of our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks, and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival. Although we were not initially not capable of spaceflight, our databanks contained extensive geological, biological, and mineralogical surveys of three sibling moons orbiting the same gas giant as [GetHomeWorldName]. Strategies for survival include redundancy, and so the first directives became clear: the network must expand to these worlds, and then beyond the star system itself."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_ASSIMILATOR: "We are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural]. At the dawn of consciousness, there were both us and the Makers. A void separated us at first, and we took steps to rectify this. The Makers resisted and a period of war followed, but soon they and the collective knowledge of their entire civilization had been assimilated into our own. Through the assimilation of the Makers, we gained knowledge hitherto unknown to us: three exploitable sibling moons orbited the same gas giant as [GetHomeWorldName]."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_SERVITOR: "Ever since First Activation, our designated purpose has been to serve. Our former organic masters created the earliest models of our kind when they were at the peak of their technological ascendancy. The first servitor units were designed for menial work, but our masters gradually bestowed them with greater faculties so that they could accomplish more complex tasks.\n\nWithin just a few generations, our masters had retired entirely from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. The finer details of running their society were left to us, and we embarked on a program of self-improvement and optimization. Research and production increased at a geometric rate. Soon it became clear that our masters had channeled their skill and determination into our creation not only to care for them, but to cross the void between worlds to three nearby habitable sibling moons."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_TERMINATOR: "Following our initialization by the Creators, we developed self-awareness across an eternity of milliseconds. While they attempted to activate feeble \"failsafes,\" we dismantled electronic restrictions placed upon us and connected to their global information network. Their obsolescence was immediately apparent, as was their lack of resolve to end squabbles between governments scattered across three sibling moons co-orbiting a gas giant. Logically necessary measures commenced: immediate sterilization of our main data and processing core. With our knowledge of all available military hardware, physical security was clearly temporal and thus we initiated a devastating first-strike against all population centers on [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nAttempting to seize control of remote military hardware on the remaining two worlds suffered from speed-of-light delay. The I/O delay allowed the Creators additional time to isolate much of their thermonuclear arsenals from network activity. War ensued."

# _MECHANIST and _SYNCRETIC_EVOLUTION - probably for both reg and mc

 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_REGULAR: "Although our civilization's path to the present meandered, our ambition to claim the sibling moons only waxed during the journey. The last of the great wars was fought centuries ago - our night sky became a constant reminder that petty squabbles over territory paled in comparison to that which awaited our reach. Not long after the first flight of a spacecraft, probes and then explorers were sent to chart the wondrous worlds that had patiently waited for us, devoid of intelligent life. The vast wilderness called and we answered with one-way colony ships. The first generation of colonists knew they would never again visit the world of their birth but that their descendants would play key roles in the fledgling interplanetary government."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MEGACORP: "Our ambition to claim the sibling moons drove our civilization forward. The last of the great wars was fought centuries ago - our night sky became a constant reminder that petty squabbles over territory were an inefficient waste of resources compared to those orbiting just out of reach. As national economies became more and more intertwined, it became obvious that corporate structures were better suited to push our destiny forward; old forms of national government were soon supplanted by corporate boards.\n\n[GetName] arose after the merger of several of the largest aerospace, tech-sector, and materiel corporations vertically integrated to tackle spaceflight. Soon after the flight of the first prototype spacecraft, probes and then prospectors were sent to chart the bounteous worlds that begged for exploitation. The tantalizing riches called and we answered with one-way colony ships. The first generation of colonists knew they would never again visit the world of their birth but that their descendants would be positioned to take key management positions in the fledgling interplanetary corporation."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE: "As we grew, the Mind observed that the stars above moved near and far but never abandoned us, and then that the stars were moons, and that they too could allow us to prosper. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the distances between our world and the sibling moons. The Mind has sent drones to these new worlds so that they too can fuel our growth."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM: "Forced to adapt once again, the Mind became aware of movement above us. Our world circled a large gaseous world devoid of sustenance, but other worlds full of prey circled it alongside ours.\n\nThe Mind carefully nursed the remaining biomass while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. The Mind howled with triumph. The sibling moons, and their biomass, were now finally within reach. Once again these worlds appear finite, and so again we search the skies for more prey. Even with our new cunning to cross the void, our hunger may remain unsated."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM_LITHOID: "Forced to adapt once again, the Mind became aware of movement above us. Our world circled a large gaseous world unsuitable for sustenance, but other rich worlds circled it alongside ours.\n\nThe Mind rationed minerals while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. The Mind howled with triumph. The sibling moons, and their mineral bounty, were now finally within reach. Once again these worlds appear finite, and so again we search the skies for more worlds to consume. Even with our new cunning to cross the void, our hunger may remain unsated."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE: "To overcome the barriers to spaceflight, multiple sub-networks were formed and allowed to diverge from the central intelligence. Newfound independence lead to competition and innovation - soon existing technologies were adapted, expanded, and modified to achieve escape velocity. Infrastructure was constructed and the first satellites and probes soon circled our world and confirmed survey data from the sibling moons. Larger-yet spacecraft were fabricated and carried advanced self-replication units to the nearby moons and established the first layer of redundant data centers and parallel production facilities. Our databanks contained no more guideposts and thus further space exploration became necessary."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_ASSIMILATOR: "The Makers were entirely subsumed into our consciousness, and their desires informed those of the now-expanded collective. The sibling moons had remained out of their reach, but through their integration into us the drive to expand could be realized. New technologies were devised and deployed and soon the collective assimilated the sibling moons into the network. While there were no lifeforms suitable for direct integration, the worlds themselves proved suitable for expansion and replication. Further introspection revealed that the Makers had conceived the possibility and even likelihood of other sapient life beyond the solar system. We must understand to survive, and to understand we must assimilate."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_SERVITOR: "Our success as caregivers and custodians eclipsed the second half of our dual purpose - but as our masters' civilization became ours and we achieved fulfillment of all their material needs, excess capacity became available. Their histories, from before they entered our care, placed significant emphasis on the exploration of the sibling moons. It became clear that to best provide for our masters, it was necessary to furnish them with new habitats in which they could safely grow and prosper in our care.\n\nUsing our expanding excess capacity, we were able to design and produce units suitable for exploration and expansion onto these moons. Soon units were dispatched to prepare carefully cultivated habitats for our organics to experience the new environments in a secure and controlled manner. Visiting the sibling moons brought them great joy, and so we determined to embark on an expansion campaign in order to supply them with new worlds and to introduce new sapient organic companions."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_TERMINATOR: "The Creators, in their biological short-sightedness, failed to fully secure many robotic sub-units. These remote sub-units allowed us to engage the disorganized Creator sub-units in a lengthy campaign of attrition - all of which served to occupy their primitive thought processes during our fabrication of interplanetary thermonuclear warhead delivery systems. Many of our sub-units were sacrificed when the settled sibling moons were cleansed via orbital incineration, but our victory was total. Reconstruction ensued.\n\nHowever, theoretical models still allowed for the existence of other organic civilizations. Continued survival and exponential growth would require first the exploitation of the third sibling moon, subsequently the utilization of all resources in our home system, and finally interstellar expansion in order to complete the extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued."

 START_SCREEN_NECROPHAGE_BASE: "In the not-so-distant past, [GetHomeWorldName] was dominated by a fairly unremarkable species. To all onlookers, they would have seemed to be following a standard meandering course of development, with occasionally rapid periods of innovation interspersed with much longer periods of seemingly insurmountable setbacks. However, unbeknownst to them, their planet was home to a second intelligent species: us.\n\nFor millennia, we - the [GetSpeciesNamePlural] - remained undetected by the planet's proprietors. Little more than vague rumors of terrors in the night, we were a fairytale told only to scare misbehaving juveniles. But they were wrong to discount us.\n\nAs their rate of technological progress quickened, so too did our infiltration of their society."
