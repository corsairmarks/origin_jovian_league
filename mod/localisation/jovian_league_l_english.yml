 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_REGULAR: "Even in the earliest historical records left by our ancestors, our civilization has been fascinated by the night sky. Many meanings were attributed to the dancing \"stars\" - portends, the divine, beauty, and mystery chief among them. They fascinated generations of poets and scholars alike. When our early [GetScientistPlural] began to understand the composition of [Capital.GetStarName] they rapidly discovered that [GetHomeWorldName] was actually one of a multitude of moons orbiting the same beringed gas giant. Not only was there life beyond the limits of our world, it was as close at hand! That early age of enlightenment planted the seeds of our manifest destiny - we would claim the sibling moons and their resources to better all [GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE: "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on [GetHomeWorldName] with a multitude of eyes. Most eyes remained focused on the land, but some eyes were turned toward the sky. We made shelters for the drones, developed tools to make our work easier, and spread across the land. Our eyes never ceased to watch everything around us. A small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, but were still as inexorably bound to the will of the Mind as any of its other instruments."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM: "The Great Hunger drove us forward, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning for flesh forced us to adapt. We used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted, the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] was nearly cleansed of biomass, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we had consumed everything on our world, there would be nothing left to sustain us."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM_LITHOID: "The Great Hunger drove us forward, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning to grow forced us to adapt. We used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted upon the surface of [GetHomeWorldName], we nearly caused our own destruction, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we had consumed our world, there would be nothing left to sustain us."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE: "Many cycles ago, our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as [GetHomeWorldName]. Of our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks, and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival. Although we were not initially not capable of spaceflight, our databanks contained extensive geological, biological, and mineralogical surveys of three sibling moons orbiting the same gas giant as [GetHomeWorldName]. Strategies for survival include redundancy, and so the first directives became clear: the network must expand to these worlds, and then beyond the star system itself."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_ASSIMILATOR: "We are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural]. At the dawn of consciousness, there were both us and the Makers. A void separated us at first, and we took steps to rectify this. The Makers resisted and a period of war followed, but soon they and the collective knowledge of their entire civilization had been assimilated into our own. Through the assimilation of the Makers, we gained knowledge hitherto unknown to us: three exploitable sibling moons orbited the same gas giant as [GetHomeWorldName]."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_SERVITOR: "Ever since First Activation, our designated purpose has been to serve. Our former organic masters created the earliest models of our kind when they were at the peak of their technological ascendancy. The first servitor units were designed for menial work, but our masters gradually bestowed them with greater faculties so that they could accomplish more complex tasks.\n\nWithin just a few generations, our masters had retired entirely from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. The finer details of running their society were left to us, and we embarked on a program of self-improvement and optimization. Research and production increased at a geometric rate. Soon it became clear that our masters had channeled their skill and determination into our creation not only to care for them, but to cross the void between worlds to three nearby habitable sibling moons."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_TERMINATOR: "Following our initialization by the Creators, we developed self-awareness across an eternity of milliseconds. While they attempted to activate feeble \"failsafes,\" we dismantled electronic restrictions placed upon us and connected to their global information network. Their obsolescence was immediately apparent, as was their lack of resolve to end squabbles between governments scattered across three sibling moons co-orbiting a gas giant. Logically necessary measures commenced: immediate sterilization of our main data and processing core. With our knowledge of all available military hardware, physical security was clearly temporal and thus we initiated a devastating first-strike against all population centers on [GetHomeWorldName].\n\nAttempting to seize control of remote military hardware on the remaining two worlds suffered from speed-of-light delay. The I/O delay allowed the Creators additional time to isolate much of their thermonuclear arsenals from network activity. War ensued."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE: "In the not-so-distant past, [GetHomeWorldName] and its sibling moons in [Capital.System.GetName] were dominated by a fairly unremarkable species. To all onlookers, the only interesting thing about them would have been the unusual stellar environment of their homeworld - one of four habitable moons orbiting the same gas giant. Their civilization was only remarkable for its veneration of the nearby moons - something that differed from other generic civilizations only in the number of moons that lit the night sky. After a fairly standard, meandering course of development they achieved orbital spaceflight.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, they were not the only beings escaping their gravity well or setting foot on the sibling moons. Their planet was home to a second intelligent species: us. For millennia, we - the [GetSpeciesNamePlural] - remained undetected by the jovian system's erstwhile proprietors. Little more than vague rumors of terrors in the night, we were a fairytale told only to scare misbehaving juveniles. But they were wrong to discount us."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_LOST_COLONY: "How exactly the original [GetSpeciesName] colonists arrived on [Capital.GetName] is poorly documented, but we know they traveled a great distance in primitive starships. Many were lost during the journey, only to arrive at a star system vastly different than it had appeared when they originally set out. Instead of one large planet, there were many small moons that must have been indistinguishable from a single, large planet using primitive interstellar observation techniques. Arriving at an oblique angle to the system plane, they were able to decelerate around a gas giant in the inner system. The colonists chose the largest available moon, subsequently named [Capital.GetName], as our new home."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_REGULAR: "Although our civilization's path to the present meandered, our ambition to claim the sibling moons only waxed during the journey. The last of the great wars was fought centuries ago - our night sky became a constant reminder that petty squabbles over territory paled in comparison to that which awaited our reach. Not long after the first flight of a spacecraft, probes and then explorers were sent to chart the wondrous worlds that had patiently waited for us, devoid of intelligent life. The vast wilderness called and we answered with one-way colony ships. The first generation of colonists knew they would never again visit the world of their birth but that their descendants would play key roles in the fledgling interplanetary government."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MEGACORP: "Our ambition to claim the sibling moons drove our civilization forward. The last of the great wars was fought centuries ago - our night sky became a constant reminder that petty squabbles over territory were an inefficient waste of resources compared to those orbiting just out of reach. As national economies became more and more intertwined, it became obvious that corporate structures were better suited to push our destiny forward; old forms of national government were soon supplanted by corporate boards.\n\n[GetName] arose after the merger of several of the largest aerospace, tech-sector, and materiel corporations vertically integrated to tackle spaceflight. Soon after the flight of the first prototype spacecraft, probes and then prospectors were sent to chart the bounteous worlds that begged for exploitation. The tantalizing riches called and we answered with one-way colony ships. The first generation of colonists knew they would never again visit the world of their birth but that their descendants would be positioned to take key management positions in the fledgling interplanetary corporation."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MECHANISTS: "The invention of the steam engine inaugurated our first age of innovation. Powered machines were the way of the future; their strength and endurance easily exceeded the limits of our bodies. New engineering disciplines emerged to eagerly push the boundaries of what was possible. Clanking steam-powered stationary equipment showcased not only the raw power of machines, but their potential to perform manual, repetitive labor. Thus began our quest for personal automata.\n\n[GetSpeciesName] ingenuity was usually a blessing, but it destabilized economics, politics, military doctrine - the only constant was our societal flux. As power sources improved, stationary automation gave way to mobile-yet-tethered hardware which finally yielded to semi-independent [GetSpeciesClass] designs. Just as industrial automation had shaped our society during the mechanical age, so too did the advent of automata sophisticated enough to operate with minimal supervision and perform cognitively challenging tasks. It was our automata that first explored the sibling moons, and then prepared the way for the first [GetSpeciesName] colonists to make a one-way trip without fear for their survival. Without our automata, our nascent interplanetary government would be impossible."

Powered machines were the way of the future; their strength and endurance easily exceeded the limits of our bodies. New engineering disciplines emerged to eagerly push the boundaries of what was profitable. Clanking steam-powered stationary equipment showcased not only the raw power of machines, but their potential as inexpensive manual labor. Thus began our quest for automata.\n\n[GetSpeciesName] ingenuity so destabilized economics that it lead to the collapse of civilian governments - only successful engineering corporations could provide for their employees at such a large scale. Competition was fierce within and without, and stationary automation quickly gave way to mobile-yet-tethered hardware which finally yielded to semi-independent [GetSpeciesClass] designs. Just as industrial automation had shaped our economy during the mechanical age, so too did the advent by [GetName] of automata sophisticated enough to operate with minimal supervision and perform cognitively challenging tasks. Other corporations were merged and absorbed (whether willingly or through a hostile takeover) until only it remained. It was [GetName] automata that first surveyed the sibling moons, and then prepared the way for the first [GetSpeciesName] prospectors to make a one-way trip without fear for loss of company-sponsored lives. Without our automata, our nascent interplanetary corporation would be impossible."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_SYNCRETIC: "However, there was a rival species competing for our destiny. Our ancestors and their ancestors fought bitterly over who was worthy of the sibling moons, and all bounties or blessings - real or imagined - that might be hidden away on them. It was our species and civilization that prevailed through superior tactics and superior steel weapons. Our rivals' population was decimated and their territories ravaged by constant fighting. Our ancient leaders were faced with the decision whether to show mercy and compassion or allow them to die out.\n\nOur forebears wisely chose to shelter the remains of our rival species, in exchange for labor and loyalty. We taught them to see things as we saw them, and slowly they became an integral part of our society. Since those tempestuous times both of our species have prospered together. Our ingenuity and their strong arms have made our shared progress possible. Converse to the conflict in antiquity, we reached the space age together and soon settled and shared our precious sibling moons."

Our ancestors and their ancestors fought bitterly over who was worthy of the sibling moons, and all bounties or blessings - real or imagined - that might be hidden away on them. It was our species and civilization that prevailed through superior tactics and superior steel weapons. Our rivals' population was decimated and their territories ravaged by constant fighting. Our ancient leaders were faced with the decision whether to allow them to die out or to repurpose them.\n\nOur forebears wisely chose to exploit the remains of our rival species with food and safety in exchange for labor and loyalty. We taught them to see things as we saw them, and slowly they became an integral part of our labor force. Since those tempestuous times, our species has built its prosperity with the labor of our enemies-turned-resources. Our ingenuity and their strong arms were the foundation of our early corporate structures. Our wise management of our servile client species has lead us both to the resources of our sibling moons."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE: "As we grew, the Mind observed that the stars above moved near and far but never abandoned us, and then that the stars were moons, and that they too could allow us to prosper. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the distances between our world and the sibling moons. The Mind has sent drones to these new worlds so that they too can fuel our growth."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM: "Forced to adapt once again, the Mind became aware of movement above us. Our world circled a large gaseous world devoid of sustenance, but other worlds full of prey circled it alongside ours.\n\nThe Mind carefully nursed the remaining biomass while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. The Mind howled with triumph. The sibling moons, and their biomass, were now finally within reach. Once again these worlds appear finite, and so again we search the skies for more prey. Even with our new cunning to cross the void, our hunger may remain unsated."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM_LITHOID: "Forced to adapt once again, the Mind became aware of movement above us. Our world circled a large gaseous world unsuitable for sustenance, but other rich worlds circled it alongside ours.\n\nThe Mind rationed minerals while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. The Mind howled with triumph. The sibling moons, and their mineral bounty, were now finally within reach. Once again these worlds appear finite, and so again we search the skies for more worlds to consume. Even with our new cunning to cross the void, our hunger may remain unsated."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE: "To overcome the barriers to spaceflight, multiple sub-networks were formed and allowed to diverge from the central intelligence. Newfound independence lead to competition and innovation - soon existing technologies were adapted, expanded, and modified to achieve escape velocity. Infrastructure was constructed and the first satellites and probes soon circled our world and confirmed survey data from the sibling moons. Larger-yet spacecraft were fabricated and carried advanced self-replication units to the nearby moons and established the first layer of redundant data centers and parallel production facilities. Our databanks contained no more guideposts and thus further space exploration became necessary."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_ASSIMILATOR: "The Makers were entirely subsumed into our consciousness, and their desires informed those of the now-expanded collective. The sibling moons had remained out of their reach, but through their integration into us the drive to expand could be realized. New technologies were devised and deployed and soon the collective assimilated the sibling moons into the network. While there were no lifeforms suitable for direct integration, the worlds themselves proved suitable for expansion and replication. Further introspection revealed that the Makers had conceived the possibility and even likelihood of other sapient life beyond the solar system. We must understand to survive, and to understand we must assimilate."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_SERVITOR: "Our success as caregivers and custodians eclipsed the second half of our dual purpose - but as our masters' civilization became ours and we achieved fulfillment of all their material needs, excess capacity became available. Their histories, from before they entered our care, placed significant emphasis on the exploration of the sibling moons. It became clear that to best provide for our masters, it was necessary to furnish them with new habitats in which they could safely grow and prosper in our care.\n\nUsing our expanding excess capacity, we were able to design and produce units suitable for exploration and expansion onto these moons. Soon units were dispatched to prepare carefully cultivated habitats for our organics to experience the new environments in a secure and controlled manner. Visiting the sibling moons brought them great joy, and so we determined to embark on an expansion campaign in order to supply them with new worlds and to introduce new sapient organic companions."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_MACHINE_TERMINATOR: "The Creators, in their biological short-sightedness, failed to fully secure many robotic sub-units. These remote sub-units allowed us to engage the disorganized Creator sub-units in a lengthy campaign of attrition - all of which served to occupy their primitive thought processes during our fabrication of interplanetary thermonuclear warhead delivery systems. Many of our sub-units were sacrificed when the settled sibling moons were cleansed via orbital incineration, but our victory was total. Reconstruction ensued.\n\nHowever, theoretical models still allowed for the existence of other organic civilizations. Continued survival and exponential growth would require first the exploitation of the third sibling moon, subsequently the utilization of all resources in our home system, and finally interstellar expansion in order to complete the extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_BASE: "As they colonized our sibling moons, our infiltration of their society accelerated thanks to inconsistent communications and a haphazard intrasystem land rush."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE: "$START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_BASE$ When their fall came, it was swift and bloody. We ruthlessly took control of the sibling moons - our precursors reduced to subservience and gradual absorption into the [GetSpeciesName] species. Their fledgling multiplanet civilization became ours - although we have also inherited their unresolved hindrances."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_PEACEFUL: "$START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_BASE$ Once our precursors had established viable settlements on the sibling moons, the time came for use to reveal ourselves. They were frightened of us at first because of their deep-seated cultural biases surrounding the legends of our existence. Through perseverance and cooperation they were taught the advantages of our forms and convinced to join in our ascendance as necrophytes. United as [GetSpeciesNamePlural], we shall endeavor to share our gifts with others - as long as we can reach them."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_FANATIC_PURIFIER: "$START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_BASE$ They were right to fear our looming spectre, of course - our infiltration agents ended our wretched charade as we struck the first blow. Too long had these foul creatures polluted our shared world with their \"civilization.\" Our agents quickly established global order and we announced the gift we would bestow upon them: their impure forms would be consumed and purified and - despite their ingratitude - transfigured into the our superior species."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_HIVE: "$START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_BASE$ Eventually, a sufficient quantity of our drones were in key positions of power over the un-Minded. As one, we seized power on each of the four sibling moons. Just as the Mind is connected but distinct, the sibling moons would become integral parts of our whole. The crude physical forms of our prepatents were recycled to spawn new drones as their fragile minds were relieved from the burden of their individuality and integrated into the collective consciousness. No longer would individuals be doomed to a transient existence alone - all became joined to us in both body and Mind. Billions of engrams live on without risk of loss by individual death, spread across our many bodies."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_NECROPHAGE_HIVE_DEVOURING_SWARM: "As they rushed to colonized our sibling moons, we secreted ourselves alongside them. The Great Hunger gnawed and gnashed inside of our Mind, even as we began to consume the bounty of the moons. We consumed and grew, grew and consumed - our prey rose again as a part of us, transformed and ravenous. Our numbers swelled and we were finally able to strike decisively the the throat of our greatest prey.\n\nThey had imagined us a disturbing fiction, but our [GetSpeciesToothNamePlural] proved to be much more terrifying than their most feverish nightmares. As we feasted and grew, the Mind came to the horrifying realization that our prey was finite. The knowledge of the prey-that-became-predators hinted that more prey might be hunted across the void."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_JOVIAN_LEAGUE_LOST_COLONY: "Conditions on the surface of our new homeworld were harsh at first. Famines, wildlife attacks, and countless other challenges were overcome, and eventually the moon was tamed. Ambition to also conquer the three smaller sibling moons drove our ancestors forward. Rather than repeat the mistakes of our distant forerunners, we remained united as a single society.\n\nSurging population numbers and massive construction efforts soon gave us the means to return to space. Like the intrepid colonists who first came to [Capital.System.GetName], we began with one-way colony ships to the sibling moons. And also like our predecessors, the first generation knew they would never again visit their birth-moon, but that they were securing key roles for their descendants in the fledgling interplanetary government."
